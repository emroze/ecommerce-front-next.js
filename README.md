## Live Website

Link: https://ecommerce-front-next-js.vercel.app/

[N.B. The website might seem slower but it is not. When I created the MongoDB database, I used Singapore as the location due to its closeness to my area for faster connectivity. But the Vercel server is in the US. Which is causing this delay]
